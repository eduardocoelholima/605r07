Here you will find a couple of code snippets as well
as some notes used in RIT course CSCI605's recitation
sessions.

### HW6.2: Chess-like game, revisited

### HW6.3: Chess-like game, 3D

### HW7.1: Multi-type storage, custom objects
https://www.cs.rit.edu/~hpb/Lectures/2211/605/605-405.html

### HW7.2: Chess-like game, 2D, with abstract classes
https://www.cs.rit.edu/~hpb/Lectures/2211/605/605-406.html

### HW7.3: Chess-like game, 2D, with interfaces
https://www.cs.rit.edu/~hpb/Lectures/2211/605/605-407.html

### Interfaces: a splittable interface

Task: code class SplitableList which implement interface Splitable and inherit
 Vector.

- SplitableList.java (main)
- SplitableListSolution.java
- Splitable.java
- SplitableListSolution2.java
- Splitable2.java

### Interfaces 2: 

Task: Code class Person comprised of strings firstName, lastName and integer
 age. Person should implement the interface Comparable. A Person object
  should be considered greater, equal or lesser than other Person object
   according to the lexicographical order.  Create a Java API's LinkedList of
    Person objects and sort them using Java API provided methods.

- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List)
- Person.java (solution)

### Interfaces 3 

Task: Create a class Node, which should hold a reference to the next
 Node and have a variable referencing a generic-typed object. Use the class
  Node to implement a Linked List comprised of Node<Person> elements.
  Do not use the Java API provided Linked List. Keep track of the last
   inserted element to the list and implement add, remove and find().
- MyLinkedList.java (solution)
- Node.java
